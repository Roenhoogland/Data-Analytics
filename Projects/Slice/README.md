### Project Overview
Slice is a small take-away-only business. The owner sought to gain insights from the data generated by the business.

#### Business Task
Develop a dashboard offering insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), monthly sales, visualization of the weekly order distribution, and an analysis of orders within half-hour increments. 
Additionally, analyze and visualize the impact of rainfall on order patterns.

### Data Sources
- Sales data was taken from the Sitedish API. The data ran from 2023-01-01 to 2023-10-31 and did not include Mondays. Data not publicly available.
- Weather(rain) data for the same time period was taken from https://www.meteoblue.com/nl/weer/historyclimate/weatherarchive/hoorn_nederland_2753638

### Tools
- Excel: data cleaning and transformation
- SQL (BigQuery): data analysis and transformation
- Tableau: visualization

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Checked for and removed duplicates
- Removed sales data entries that missed significant information.
-	Split time from the data and rounded down to the nearest 30 minutes, forming half-hour time blocks.
- Created new column for date, month and weekday (1=sun - 7=sat)
- Trimmed the weather dataset to include only information aligning with business hours.
- In a new column (Rain), created a dichotomous variable that read 'Yes' (If rain on said date is > 0.01mm) or 'No' (If else). So, in cases where rain occurred during business hours, the corresponding entry for that date in indicated 'yes.'


### Data Analysis (SQL)
- Exploratory analyses
- Join ON date to link the sale table to the rain table
- Query to SELECT COUNT orders and GROUP BY time block, date, weekday, and month

Exported the Query results and created a '0' dummy variable for each time block that had no sales.



### Results
- The most orders are on Sunday and Friday (24% and 22% respectively), followed by Saturday and Thursday (18% and 15% respectively), trailed by Wednesday and Tuesday (11% and 10% respectively).

### Limitations
- The ordering patterns in connection with rainfall data may exhibit bias, given that precipitation is more frequent in spring, autumn, and winter, particularly in the latter when days are shorter. Consequently, it seems plausible that customers place orders earlier during these seasons compared to the longer days of summer. To address this, it would be prudent to examine the monthly distribution of orders.
- In the current analysis, rain is dichotomously categorized as 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether it occurred during business hours on a given day. However, if the rainfall is minimal and occurs only towards the end of business hours, it is less likely to impact sales at the beginning of the business day.
